Send your Rinkeby internetDAI in a stream, because you can!

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the Metamask Chrome extension installed.

Make sure your account has Ether to pay for gas and some testnetDAIs to send. (You can mint your own using this [contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xc3dbf84abb494ce5199d5d4d815b10ec29529ff8))

Javascript is required for this to work.

Enter your recipients address, the quantity of internetDAIs you want to send (it might be slightly adjusted to fit the amount of seconds in the duration)

Enter how long you'd like the stream to take.

### Future Features

* See the status of the streams, both incoming and outgoing using the sablier subgraph [(here)](thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/sablierhq/sablier-rinkeby)

* Withdraw from the stream [(here)](https://docs.sablier.finance/streams#withdraw-from-stream)

* Modify the duration of the stream by a few seconds instead of the amount sent if it's in a reasonable deviation from the intended time (maybe 2%?)
